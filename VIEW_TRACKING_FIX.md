# View Tracking Double Count Fix

## Problem

Article view count was incrementing by 2 instead of 1 when users visited an article page, happening on both same device and different devices.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **React StrictMode** in development mode causes useEffect to run twice
2. **Race conditions** between multiple ViewTracker component mounts
3. **Insufficient protection** against rapid successive tracking calls

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced ViewTracker Component

-   Added `mounted` ref to track component lifecycle
-   Added `isTracking` state to prevent race conditions
-   Enhanced session storage with timestamp-based protection (1 hour window)
-   Added delay (200ms) to prevent immediate double calls in StrictMode
-   Improved logging for debugging

### 2. Improved Backend API

-   Changed protection window from "daily" to "hourly" for better immediate protection
-   Added database transaction for atomicity
-   Added double-check within transaction to prevent race conditions
-   Enhanced logging for better debugging
-   Added response information about whether tracking actually occurred

### 3. Protection Mechanisms

-   **Session Storage**: Timestamp-based tracking with 1-hour protection window
-   **Database Level**: IP-based protection with 1-hour window
-   **Component Level**: Multiple ref checks and state management
-   **Race Condition**: Proper async handling and cleanup

## Testing

To test the fix:

1. **Clear tracking history**:

    ```javascript
    // In browser console
    clearArticleViewTracking();
    ```

2. **Check current tracking**:

    ```javascript
    // In browser console
    showArticleViewTracking();
    ```

3. **Monitor console logs**: View tracking now logs detailed information

## Files Modified

-   `/components/ViewTracker.tsx` - Enhanced tracking logic
-   `/app/api/articles/[slug]/track-view/route.ts` - Improved backend protection
-   `/public/debug-view-tracking.js` - Debug utilities

## Expected Behavior

-   First visit to article: Count increments by 1
-   Subsequent visits within 1 hour: No increment
-   After 1 hour: Count can increment again
-   Detailed console logging shows tracking status

## Notes

-   Protection window is 1 hour (configurable)
-   Works for both development (React StrictMode) and production
-   Maintains user experience while preventing double counting
-   Logging can be disabled in production if needed
